# Features

LeviLauncher is centered on day-to-day Minecraft Bedrock launcher workflows. Native mod APIs exist, but they are an extension point for developers rather than the default user path.

## Version and Instance Management

Use versions and instances to keep different Minecraft setups separated. Version isolation is especially useful when testing imported versions, mods, worlds, or settings that should not affect your main setup.

## Content Management

The launcher includes tools for managing worlds, resource packs, and related launcher data. Use these tools to import content, export content, or create backups before risky changes.

Backups are intended for recovery and migration. Keep important backups outside the app data directory as well if the data matters.

## Xbox Accounts

LeviLauncher can manage multiple Xbox accounts inside the launcher. Select the account you want before launching Minecraft so the game starts with the expected identity.

## Quick Launch

Quick Launch uses Minecraft URI actions to jump directly into common flows. Depending on the action, you can open a game screen, connect to a server, add a server, join a Realm, load a local world, or execute a command.

## Native Modules

Native SO modules are supported for users who intentionally install them and for developers building extensions. These modules run native code, so only install packages you trust.

Developer documentation lives under [Developer](/guide/developer), with the Preloader API reference available from that section.
